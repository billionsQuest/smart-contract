## 🌐 Overview:

Billions offers a unique blockchain-based platform with battles, token transactions, NFT minting, and an NFT marketplace. These contracts serve as the backbone for the operations on the Billions platform.

## 📁 Contracts:

- **BattleContract**: Manages battles where users stake tokens, participate in battles, and claim rewards.
- **ERC20Token**: An ERC20-compliant token contract tailored for the Billions platform.
- **ScalarNFT**: An ERC721-compliant NFT contract with built-in pseudo-random number generation.
- **BillionsNFT**: Customized ERC721 NFT contract for the unique needs of the Billions platform.
- **MarketPlace**: Facilitates NFT auctions, allowing users to list, bid, and trade NFTs.

## 🛠 Setup and Installation:

To interact with or deploy the contracts, you'll need a local Ethereum development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone <repository_url> billions-contracts
cd billions-contracts
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Compile Contracts**:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## 🧪 Testing:

Thorough testing is crucial. To run the provided tests:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## 🚀 Deployment:

To deploy the contracts to a desired Ethereum network:

1. Set up your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (e.g., `PRIVATE_KEY`, `INFURA_API_KEY`, `SECRETPHASE`).

2. Deploy using:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network <network_name> scripts/deploy.js
```

Replace `<network_name>` with your desired network (e.g., `mainnet`, `rinkeby`, `ropsten`, `mumbai`).

## 🔐 Security:

Security is our top priority. Always ensure to conduct thorough audits and tests before deploying contracts to a production environment. We encourage the community to audit our contracts and join us in creating a safer ecosystem.
